For all my projects, I’m passionate about continuously working to find better ways to solve problems and to create the most optimal solution possible. My current focus for a career is in Tax Accounting, which I will be furthering via an internship this upcoming summer.\nOutside of my academics and work, I love baking; playing video games, completing puzzles; taking Pilates and ballet classes; and spending time with my friends, family, and my two cats!\nFun Fact: my favorite theorem is the Infinite Monkey Theorem.\n\n\n\nMy Cats!"
