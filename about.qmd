I'm currently a third year Statistics & Data Science Major and Accounting Minor at UCLA. For all my projects, I'm passionate about continuously working to find better ways to solve problems and to create the most optimal solution possible. My current focus for a career is in Tax Accounting, which I will be furthering via an internship this upcoming summer.

Outside of my academics and work, I love baking; playing video games, completing puzzles; taking Pilates and ballet classes; and spending time with my friends, family, and my two cats!
